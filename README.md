Slot filling using RNN seq2seq model

In this project, I have a dataset consisting of two columns, where first column is user sentence and second 
column consist of its slots. I have used RNN seq2seq model and trained it on given dataset for 
filling th slots given sentence as a input.

With this model, I was able to get an accuracy of 99.6%
